# Rage's SPT Mods

## Installation

In order to use this repo all you need to do is download the appropriate script for your OS:

- [Linux](/update-spt-and-mods.sh)
- [Windows](/update-spt-and-mods.bat)

place that script into your SPT install folder and then run it!

## Updating

Once you've ran that script once you both have git installed and your SPT folder is a git repo with all my mods, so at that point all you need to do is pull down the latest changes!

### OS Independant:
Running the following from CMD/Bash/Your shell of choice to pull the latest version

```sh
git pull
```
