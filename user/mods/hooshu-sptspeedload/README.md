# SPT-SpeedLoad

This mod allows magazines to be loaded and unloaded with ammo much faster than before.

Vanilla Speed:

-   Loading: 0.85
-   Unloading: 0.3

SPT-SpeedLoad Speed:

-   Loading: 0.3
-   Unloading: 0.05

The speeds offered by the mod can be changed in the config.json file inside the mod folder.
I have no idea what happens if you set the values too low or too high, so modify them at your own risk.
